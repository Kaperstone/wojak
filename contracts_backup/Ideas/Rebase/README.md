What everyone else are writing:
```

The first algorithmic stablecoin on Avalanche Mainnet, pegged to the price of 1 SOMETHING via seigniorage.

```

I really have no strength to explain this, this token will have a different approach.

Three tokens:

# MUMU
Users will deposit stable tokens into the pool and will receive Mumu tokens in exchange.
Mumu holders are eligable to receive kUSD.

Stable tokens will go to investment strategies and generate revenue, 
the revenue will be collected and used for buyback of kUSD, LP on Biswap/Pancakeswap & for treasury growth, to create a permanent treasury that will hold the platform on its legs, even if the everyone run away.

Mumu tokens aren't meant to be swapped, but if the community so desires, its their choice.
Every mumu can be swapped back to receive BUSD back + kUSD profits.

kUSD is being minted only when its above 1$

# kUSD
when under 1$, the platform will use Mumu revenues to buyback & burn
There will also be an option to convert kUSD to Bobo tokens with a revenue curve to better incentivize humanoids to actually buy those discounted tokens.

When above 1$
10% will be sold to increase the treasury size
90% will go to Mumu holders.
